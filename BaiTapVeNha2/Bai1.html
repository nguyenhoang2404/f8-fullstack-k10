        <h1>Low and Slow</h1>
        <p>This week i am extremely exicited about cooking technique called sous vide. In sous vibe cooking, you submerde the food (usually vaccum sealed in plastic)
        into a wter bath thar is aprecisele set to the target temperature you want the food to be cooked to. In his book, Cooking fir Geeks, Jeff Potter
        describes ir as "ultra-low temperature poaching"
        </p>
        <p>Next month, we will be serving Sous Vide Salmon with Dill Hollandaise. To reserve a seat ar the chef table, contact us before November 30.</p>
